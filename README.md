<h1>What am I using in my project?</h1>

<h3>I am using reactjs with firebase in this project.</h3>


1-for firebase, I am using some functions.
- HEAD initializeApp: for initializing app with firebase.

- getAuth: for creat Authentication like SignUp, SignIn, SignOut.
- getFirestore: for holding your application database.
- getStorage: this allows us to add some data or what we need to firebase.
Also, we import other methods like collection, onSnapshot to deal with data in firebase.

2-for Reactjs
  we imported react-router-dom: for navigating between pages.

- use Some hooks like useEffect, useState, useParam.
- use react-icons to add some icons for its pretty much easy to use.
- I have used Tailwind css.
- I used react-toastify for alert.
- I used axios for api.
